# How I Built the App

## Design

I started off designing the interface on paper, as it was easy to position elements easily.  I wanted to keep the design as clean as possible, inspired by real life to do list cards. 

## Learning

As I'd never done iOS development before, I had to learn the basics before I could get started. Thankfully, there's an incredible amount of courses and tutorial available online for free. 

I initially followed a simple one to make a very simple card shuffling game. This introduced me to the storyboard, which is an approachable way to design interfaces. I learnt to attach simple event listeners to buttons to modify the view. I also learnt in this tutorial to navigate Xcode which was initially very intimidating.

I didn't feel ready to start building yet. I decided to follow another course to become familiar with building a larger app. This one was very useful as it taught me how to set out the file structure, separating models and views. Also, I learned to actually program in Swift, rather than using the storyboard, which opened up so many new options.

Once I started building the app, most of the learning was done through specific videos on topics (eg: reminders, drag and drop), as well as Apple Documentation. I often found the documentation to be unhelpful when solving issues, and StackOverflow answers seemed to explain them better.

## Implementation

The first thing I did after setting up the project was importing assets from my XD storyboard into the workspace. This took me much longer than expected, as I didn't realize Xcode has no SVG support, and I had to convert all the icons beforehand. The color sets interface was quite nice though, as I could add colors visually through an interface, which I can then reference through their names in code. The first task I did was to make the themes, to get them out of the way. I created a theme protocol that loads the colors into a static variable, so I wouldn't have to program them separately into each UI element.

After this, I created the interfaces for the

## Technical Skills

### Native iOS Applications

I learnt to build a Native iOS application, which I had never done before, particularly the architecture of an iOS application. I learnt about how interfaces are created using ViewControllers, and the different threads to assign tasks to.

### The Swift Language

I also chose to code in Swift, rather than Objective-C as it was a newer language and appears easier to use. I learned about the various data types, and the traditional programming constructs (eg: loops, conditions etc). 

One thing I liked in particular, which I've not found elsewhere was the `if let` syntax which only assigns a variable if it exists, without throwing an exception. I also loved the fact that you can appply extensions to existing classes, to modify them or add in any additional functionality! The only think I disliked about it was the heavy syntax and strongly typed variables, which I am not used to, as I am more familiar with scripting languages like Python and JS.

### UI Design

Although I had prior experience with designing a UI from the Team project last year, 

### Version Control

I also used Git to to save my progress. 

## Professional Skills

### Problem Solving

### Autonomy

This was one of the hardest skills to master. I had to tackle most of the challenges alone since everyone was making different apps, and it was not possible to get help with implementing specific features. I searched for help on the internet whenever I could, but there were certain instances where only I could understand the logic of the code I had written to figure out the problem. I had to build up the ability to independently debug and find solutions without relying on others.

This skill will be critical for my future career, since building unique apps will come with unique problems to solve. Additionally, I would have to become self-taught in a lot of frameworks without guidance or supervision, and I feel like this course helped me to practice this. Outside of Uni, I think this skill will help me to become less dependent on others throughout my life.
